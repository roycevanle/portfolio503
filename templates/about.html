    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="flow-text">
    	My name is Royce Le and I'm curently a second year, majoring in Informatics, at the University of Washington. Despite not having the privilege of parents whom were born here and know how to navigate technology and the school system, I was able to be the first person in my family to go to college. Realizing the sacrifices my parents made to help me and the work I put into getting to college, I want to help those who are limping behind in the race of life because of the lack of privileges presented to them. With an Informatics degree, I don’t want to just get an education, a diploma, and a job; I want to impact other people’s lives by giving them access to technology so that they may have equal opportunity at education and jobs. I can choose any other major to earn money and donate to an organization to help people access technology, but an Informatics degree will equip me with the knowledge and tools to create a new technological culture that includes all underrepresented and underprivileged people. To create the new culture, I will join nonprofit organizations like Connecting for Good or start my own nonprofit. My nonprofit would include building community technology centers, supplying the community with courses which help them understand how to use the internet and online resources, revamping PCs and selling them for low prices, and collaborating with local organizations to implement more technology available to the public at their establishments. Like dominoes, a degree will change me, I will change a community, and the community will change the world.
